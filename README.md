#Hello everbody;

-I did test cases using both testNG and Cucumber;

-I used hook class for if there was an error it takes screenshot and close the webdriver,because if there was an another test cases it could be continue.

-I used background in ebebek.feature file because if there will be need to another Scenarios for ebebek this background can be used for reach the baseurl

-I used POM for both cucumber and testNG (pages,runners,stepdefs,utilities,resourcess,test-output)

-I used Log4j for tstsNg if there is an error and it logged in the target/logs file

-I used javascript executior and wait class in my test cases

-I used configurations.properties file for base_url etc... and fro use it ı create configReader class

-I find bugs and ı used jira to report them

-I used postman and jira for manual testing
